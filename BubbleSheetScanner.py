# Step #1: Detect the exam in an image.
# Step #2: Apply a perspective transform to extract the top-down, birds-eye-view of the exam.
# Step #3: Extract the set of bubbles (i.e., the possible answer choices) from the perspective transformed exam.
# Step #4: Sort the questions/bubbles into rows.
# Step #5: Determine the marked (i.e., “bubbled in”) answer for each row.
# Step #6: Lookup the correct answer in our answer key to determine if the user was correct in their choice.
# Step #7: Repeat for all questions in the exam.
