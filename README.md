# Omr Test Grader

Very basic but important project to start off in the computer vision domaain. This project was built by taking the reference from  https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ by Adrian Rosebrock. He is very good with explaining the code examples and implementaion of it.

## To accomplish this, our implementation will need to satisfy the following 7 steps: 

Step #1: Detect the exam in an image.

Step #2: Apply a perspective transform to extract the top-down, birds-eye-view of the exam.

Step #3: Extract the set of bubbles (i.e., the possible answer choices) from the perspective transformed exam.

Step #4: Sort the questions/bubbles into rows.

Step #5: Determine the marked (i.e., “bubbled in”) answer for each row.

Step #6: Lookup the correct answer in our answer key to determine if the user was correct in their choice.

Step #7: Repeat for all questions in the exam.
